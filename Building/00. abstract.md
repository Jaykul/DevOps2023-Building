Invoke-Build: PowerShell in CI/CD

This is a talk about building, testing, and deploying with PowerShell scripts, and ways to design your workflow such that you can run the same build locally that you run on your CI/CD environment. Everyone will go home with their hands full of tips and tricks for using PowerShell in CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, workflows, and more.

Our primary goal is to do most of the coordination of build/test/deploy in PowerShell, regardless of whether you're building PowerShell modules, or any other sort of software, whether it's ASP.NET or Node web apps, Windows Forms, or Java console apps.

Essentially, we will exploring the functionality of PowerShell as a cross-platform scripting engine while looking at cross-platform modules for builds like Invoke-Build and PSake. We'll cover the benefits (and pitfalls) of doing _everything_ in PowerShell. We'll talk about what steps you can easily make work everywhere, and which will only work on your CI/CD environment or your local laptop. We'll discuss the missing "workflow" functionality of being able to suspend and resume, without re-running, and we'll discuss logging and errors and how you can make them verbose when you won't be able to interactively debug.
