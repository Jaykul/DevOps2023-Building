If you take a look at what went in to a single feature release of BuildKit, you might have a better understanding of the featureset of this tool that you think is just for compiling Dockerfiles...

https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.11.0

### Now take a look at some spin-off tools:

- [Depot](https://depot.dev/) is all about building Docker images faster. Aggressive cloud caching of layers. Build agents with native 16-CPU servers for every platform, including AWS Graviton and Apple Silicon. Billed per minute.
- [Sanic](https://github.com/webappio/sanic) is an Open Source parallel builder. It builds all the Dockerfiles in your repo simultaneously, with support for templating and more.
- [Earthly](https://github.com/earthly/earthly#faq) is a CI/CD Framework, based on BuildKit, it's like Dockerfile + Makefile
- [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#specifying-workspaces) is a CI/CD Server that's all Kubernetes native. It's very powerful for organizations that are fully Kubernetes native, with k8s-yaml aware dev teams.
